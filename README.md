# Purification of plasmid DNA using membrane separation processes: modeling and application
> PhD Thesis build with LaTeX

This repository contains the source code of my PhD thesis. It is a typical LaTeX project. The entry point is `tese.tex` (read the section below to see how to build the project).

## Installing / Getting started

To compile the project, a viable TeX distribution must be installed. This guide assumes the following setup:

- Operating system: macOS
- Text editor: Sublime Text 3

1. **Install MacTeX**. For macOS, the [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) distribution contains everything that is needed, including a complete TeX system with LaTeX itself and editors to write documents (the build was tested with the [full MacTeX distribution](http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) only).

2. **Install LatexTools sublime text package**. Check [LaTeXTools Docs](https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see how to install and configure the package.

### Building

To build the project, open `tese.tex` file in sublime and run the build command with the shortcut <kbd>âŒ˜B</kbd>. If there are no errors in the build process, the final thesis document will be written to `tese.pdf`.
